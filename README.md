# Ion (WIP) 
**Written in Python so you can write in Python**

Ion is a lightweight, forward-leaning Python IDE built by people who actually write code, not by committees. It’s designed to be fast, minimal, and dead-simple to extend. If you want a tool that gets out of your way and lets you actually build things, you’re in the right place.

## Features (WIP)

### • Project Creation Made Easy  
Spin up a new project with sane defaults, automatic folder setup, and a generated `main.py` ready to go.

### • Clean, Focused Interface  
No clutter. No bloat. Just what you need to write Python comfortably.

### • Built With PyQt  
Ion runs on PyQt, giving you a smooth native UI without the Frankenstein mess of webview-based editors.

### • File Manager Included  
Navigate your project structure, open folders, switch files, and keep your workspace organized.

### • Popup Dialogs That Don’t Fight You  
Collect user inputs (like project names, paths, or quick settings) with custom dialogs built for speed and clarity.

### • Extensible by Design  
Ion is written in Python, so you can crack it open and mod it however you want. No gatekeeping, no nonsense.

## Why Ion? (WIP)

Because the world doesn’t need yet another bloated “IDE” pretending it’s a cloud OS. We dont shove Github Copilot in your face unlike some other enviorments. Ion sticks to the basics: write code, save code, run code. That’s it. Old-school discipline with modern speed. 

And yeah — **Ion is written in Python so you can write in Python.**

## Roadmap

- Integrated terminal  
- Debugger integration  
- LSP support  
- Code formatter hooks (Black, Ruff, etc.)  

If you’ve got ideas, open an issue. If you’ve got opinions, welcome to the club.

## Contributing (WIP)

Pull requests are open to anyone who isn’t afraid to break things in the name of improvement.  
Follow standard Git workflows. Don’t overthink it.

## License

MIT. Because locking down an IDE written in Python would be ridiculous.
